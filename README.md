# Coffee-Wifi

I've built a two-page website using Flask, Jinja, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The first page is a simple home page created with a basic Bootstrap template. The second page is where the magic happens - you can explore a list of my favorite coffee shops, complete with information about their WiFi strength. â˜•ðŸ“¶

But that's not all! I've also added a hidden page to the websiteâ€”a form that allows you to add new coffee shop data. Once submitted, this information is stored in a CSV file. It's been an incredible learning experience, and I'm proud of the progress I've made. ðŸ’ª
